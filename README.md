# Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation Calculator

This project contains a Python function `calculate()` that takes a list of 9 numbers, converts it to a 3x3 matrix, and returns the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along rows, columns, and the entire matrix.

## How to use

1. Make sure you have Python 3 and NumPy installed.
2. Import the function and call it with a list of 9 numbers.

Example:

```python
from mean_var_std import calculate

data = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
result = calculate(data)
print(result)
